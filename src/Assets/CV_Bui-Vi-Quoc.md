## 🙋🏻‍♂️Brief introduction

> Hi, I'm a student who can code and learn about technology all day without getting tired.

I started learning to code three years ago, mainly about C++ and competition programming (data structures & algorithms). That helped me win some achievements and get a position as a programming instructor at an academy.

In the past year, I have been very focused on learning web programming. And I'm trying to be a good software engineer.
